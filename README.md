# ARstorefinder
AR stands for augmented reality.As we all know the sensational pokemon go game played in AR.
I want to create a android application which displays store names on live camera feed using markerless AR application.
This can be created using softwares like blender for creating 3d models and using unity to develop AR android app.
This requires code to be written in c#.

This is also open for contributions of 3D models from designers
